# Sparse Matrices and GNN from scratch

This repo contains code that implements common functions on dense matrices and sparse mattrices in COO format.

On top of that the repo contains code that impements end-to-end GNN training and inference.

## WARNING

This code was made as code assignment and it is not user-friendly, however the code is well organized and quite self explanatory.
